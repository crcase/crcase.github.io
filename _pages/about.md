Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.uiowa.edu/) at the [University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu/). I received my PhD from the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.unc.edu/) at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/) in 2024, my M.A. in Political Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2021, and my B.A. in Economics and Political Science from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) in 2019.

My primary research agenda focuses on the strategic behavior of congressional candidates and members of Congress with a methodological focus on measurement and text as data. My research has been published in outlets such as the _Journal of Politics, Political Science Research and Methods_, and _Political Behavior_. In ongoing projects, I seek to measure the policy positioning of congressional candidates from campaign website text, both at the aggregate level and in individual policy areas. Using these measurements, I am interested in explaining changes in candidate positioning and the broader implications of these positions for election and legislative outcomes.
