Welcome! I am a PhD Student in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.unc.edu/) at [the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/). I earned my M.A. in Political Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2021 and my B.A. in Economics and Political Science from [the University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/) in 2019. My research aims to answer important questions about American elections with an emphasis on both elite and mass behavior. More specifically, I am interested in how political elites aim to maximize their electoral chances through both rhetoric and policy passed as well as the impact of this behavior and other real world events on voters' decision making and political attitudes. In answering these questions, I employ both machine learning as well as advanced survey methods.

In my dissertation, I study the development and implications of electoral sub-brands in U.S. congressional primary elections. I also have ongoing projects on candidate ideology in U.S. primary elections for the House of Representatives.
