Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.unc.edu/) at [the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/). I earned my M.A. in Political Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2021 and my B.A. in Economics and Political Science from [the University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/) in 2019. 

My research focuses on American politics and Congress. In both solo- and co-authored work, I analyze the ways in which electoral dynamics shape candidate and member behavior, and the implications of this behavior as it relates to election outcomes, lawmaking, polarization, and representation. My dissertation builds on my broader research agenda by using both text and image analysis to assess how candidates differentiate themselves from co-partisans in primary elections and how this behavior shapes citizen perceptions of candidates. In pursuing this broader research agenda, I develop and employ computational methods to offer new perspectives on questions related to representation in American politics.
