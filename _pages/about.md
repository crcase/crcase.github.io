Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.unc.edu/) at [the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/). Beginning in fall 2024, I will be an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.uiowa.edu/) at [the University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu/). I earned my M.A. in Political Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2021 and my B.A. in Economics and Political Science from [the University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/) in 2019. 

My substanative research agenda focuses on the strategic behavior of congressional candidates and members of Congress with a methodological focus on measurement and text as data. In my dissertation research and related projects, I explore the ways in which candidates respond to electoral dynamics, specifically in the context of primary elections, as well as the implications of this behavior as it relates to election outcomes, lawmaking, polarization, and representation. In pursuing this research agenda, my work develops and employs advanced computational methods.
