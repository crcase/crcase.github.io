Welcome! I am a PhD Student in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.unc.edu/) at [the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/). I earned my M.A. in Political Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2021 and my B.A. in Economics and Political Science from [the University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/) in 2019. My research aims to answer important questions about American elections with an emphasis on both elite and mass behavior. More specifically, I am interested in how political elites aim to maximize their electoral chances through both rhetoric and policy passed as well as the impact of this behavior and other real world events on voters' decision making and political attitudes. 

In my [dissertation](/files/porter_research_statement.pdf), I investigate if and how candidates discuss important issues-of-the-day like the Opioid Epidemic and the #MeToo movement in terms of their local constituency. To assess this association, I employ an original data set of text on campaign position taking. This collection of over 29,000 policy positions from nearly 4,000 candidate websites constitutes the first comprehensive data set of congressional campaign text on issue positions. My dissertarion research is supported by the Social Science Research Council's [Social Data Dissertation Fellowship](https://items.ssrc.org/from-our-programs/the-social-science-research-council-announces-the-recipients-of-the-social-data-research-and-dissertation-fellowships/), which funds projects that make creative use of social data and employ cutting edge methods to investigate democracy.
