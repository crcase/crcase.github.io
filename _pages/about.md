Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.unc.edu/) at [the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/). I earned my M.A. in Political Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2021 and my B.A. in Economics and Political Science from [the University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/) in 2019. My research focuses primarily on questions about American elections with an emphasis on both elite and mass behavior. More specifically, I am interested in how political elites aim to maximize their electoral chances through both rhetoric and policies, as well as the impact of this behavior and other real world events on voters' decision making and political attitudes. In answering these questions, I employ machine learning, text analysis, and advanced survey methods.

In my dissertation, I aim to answer the question of how candidates running for Congress differentiate themselves in primary elections and how this shapes voters' behavior and attitudes. Using an original data set of websites from over 2,000 candidates for the House of Representatives in 2022, I use machine learning to demonstrate how clusters of candidates engage in branding by adopting similar color schemes, font styles, and symbols. I also use recent advances in word embeddings to show candidates who adopt these symbolic aspects of a brand possess similar ideologies and issue messaging. In the second half of my dissertation, I use survey experiments with conjoint and factorial designs to assess voters' brand awareness and recall of candidate brands. I also test the extent to which voters rely on these brands in their decision making process in voting in primary elections.
