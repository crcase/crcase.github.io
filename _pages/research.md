My current work examines (1) the ways in which political elites message and pass public policy to maximize electoral chances and (2) the effect of elite rhetoric, public policy, and real world events on voters' behavior and political attitudes. I have primarily focused on these questions in the context of Congress, specifically intra-party competition in primary elections, but I also have research applying these questions more broadly. Additionally, I have worked as a part of a research team assessing the factors that contribute to racial disparities in traffic stops.

"Partisan Appeals to Bipartisanship." *with Emily Cottle Ommundsen.*  Forthcoming at Political Behavior [[Paper]](/files/Case%20Cottle%20Partisan%20Appeals%20to%20Bipartisanship.pdf) [[Replication Materials]](https://github.com/crcase/partisan-appeals-to-bipartisanship)

> How do members of Congress build public support for legislation? Many argue it is through the framing of the legislative process or carefully curated explanations that appeal to their constituents' preferences. Some suggest the key to members of Congress building public support for legislation is appealing to bipartisanship — signaling to the public that legislation was crafted through compromise and is liked by members on both sides of the aisle. Given the hyper-partisan era that presently exists, however, these bipartisan appeals are unlikely to occur in a vacuum. The minority party has incentives to engage in counter framing to undermine support for legislation. We demonstrate that the benefits awarded to members by engaging in bipartisan appeals are overstated. By engaging in counter messaging, members in the minority party can undermine the legislative accomplishments of their opponents, as well as approval for the legislature. Minority-party members, however, must be careful in how they counter message: partisan, rather than neutral, messages actually increase support for the legislature's majority party while decreasing support for the minority party.

"The Selling of Experience in the 2022 Congressional Elections." *with Sarah Treul.* Under Review

>Past experience in elective office has always been the best predictor of congressional candidate success in elections. These “quality” candidates come into elections with experience fundraising, name recognition, and general knowledge about how to run a successful campaign. Yet, recent congressional elections have seen an increase in the electoral success of inexperienced candidates. As past experience in office may no longer be valued as it once was, how are experienced candidates marketing themselves to voters? Are they still leaning into their past experience in elected office or are they more likely to emphasize other occupations and
experiences? We expect candidates brand themselves, emphasizing different experiences, based on the type of election they are in and who they are running against. In order to test these expectations, this paper examines all available biography pages of experienced candidates who ran in congressional primaries in 2022. We find clear partisan differences in what candidates past occupational backgrounds they highlight. We find mixed evidence that decisions about what occupations to emphasize vary based on electoral dynamics.

"Estimating Ideology for U.S. House of Representatives Primary Candidates: Word Embeddings and Campaign Websites." [[Working Paper]](/files/EstimatingIdeology.pdf)

>While a broad range of research has focused on polarization and congressional primary	elections (e.g. Thomsen 2014; Hall 2015; Bonica and Cox 2017), current measures of candidate ideology present significant limitations for the study of candidate behavior and polarization. To improve upon existing measures of congressional primary candidates' ideology, I use word embeddings with document-level vectors trained on congressional candidates' issue statements, as presented on their campaign websites. The estimates produced from this procedure are highly correlated with previous measures of elite ideology, such as DW-Nominate and CF Scores. I demonstrate the desirable properties of this measure, including (1) expanding the number of candidates with ideal-point estimates, (2) capturing candidate behavior versus perceptions of candidate behavior, and (3) the ability to validate the measure against underlying candidate behavior. Furthermore, I provide recommendations for researchers to consider when choosing a measure of candidate ideology.

"Measuring Early Campaign Contributions." *with Rachel Porter* [[Working Paper]](/files/early_money.pdf)

>Political professionals and scholars maintain that raising money early in the election season is critical to a successful campaign, having downstream consequences on a candidate's future fundraising potential, the stiffiness of competition she will face, and her likelihood of electoral victory. In spite of early money's purported explanatory power, there is no common operationalization for money as \early." In this paper, we lay out a conceptual framework for early campaign fundraising and evaluate the relative success of existing modes for measurement in capturing definitional attributes of early receipts. We empirically demonstrate significant measurement bias in certain early money measures, and tie this bias to complexities in the campaign contribution data generating process. Finally, we demonstrate that differences across approaches for measuring early money lead to (1) variability in estimates for candidates' early fundraising potential, and (2) inferential inconsistencies in the relationship between early fundraising and electoral success.

"Infectious Moderation: Personal Experiences and Political Attitudes during Covid-19." [[Working Paper]](/files/infectiousmoderation.pdf)

>Party elites in the United States sent drastically different messages about government priorities and who was to blame for the Covid-19 pandemic. Given the current era of hyper-partisanship, one would expect public opinion to diverge and follow partisan messaging faithfully. However, the Covid-19 pandemic provided citizens with personal experiences that were potentially powerful enough overcome partisan motivated reasoning and encourage voters to hold politicians accountable. Using a mix of cross sectional and panel data, I find that being personally infected with Covid-19 moderated the effects of partisanship in shaping political attitudes where citizens might otherwise be expected to follow partisan cues. Those same personal experiences carried electoral consequences for the 2020 presidential election. Although the events associated with the 2020 pandemic and presidential election are unlikely to repeat themselves, these results carry broader implications for citizens' capacity to hold attitudes independent of partisanship. Partisanship is certainly a powerful force, even in the face of a global pandemic, but its influence does have boundaries.
