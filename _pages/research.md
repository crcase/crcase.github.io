My current work examines (1) the ways in which political elites message and pass public policy to maximize electoral chances and (2) the effect of elite rhetoric, public policy, and real world events on voters' behavior and political attitudes. I have primarily focused on these questions in the context of congressional primaries, specifically intra-party competition within the Democratic Party, but I also have research applying these questions during the 2020 presidential election.

"Infectious Moderation: Personal Experiences and Political Attitudes during Covid-19". [[Paper]](/files/infectiousmoderation.pdf)

>Party elites in the United States sent drastically different messages about government priorities and who was to blame for the Covid-19 pandemic. Given the current era of hyper-partisanship, one would expect public opinion to diverge and follow partisan messaging faithfully. However, the Covid-19 pandemic provided citizens with personal experiences that were potentially powerful enough overcome partisan motivated reasoning and encourage voters to hold politicians accountable. Using a mix of cross sectional and panel data, I find that being personally infected with Covid-19 moderated the effects of partisanship in shaping political attitudes where citizens might otherwise be expected to follow partisan cues. Those same personal experiences carried electoral consequences for the 2020 presidential election. Although the events associated with the 2020 pandemic and presidential election are unlikely to repeat themselves, these results carry broader implications for citizens' capacity to hold attitudes independent of partisanship. Partisanship is certainly a powerful force, even in the face of a global pandemic, but its influence does have boundaries.

"Running as a Woman?: Candidate Presentation in the 2018 Midterms" *with Maura McDonald and Sarah Treul.* (2020) Political Research Quarterly, 73(4): 967-987 [[Paper]](/files/women_final.pdf) [[Supplemental Information]](/files/women_appendix.pdf)

> The record high number of women who ran for the U.S. Congress during the midterm elections led many journalists proclaim 2018 as another “Year of the Woman.” Although not every female candidate was successful, this large number of women running for of- fice provides the opportunity to advance our understanding of the ways in which women present themselves to their voters. Using the “Biography” pages of over 1,500 2018 con- gressional campaign websites, we utilize a structural topic model to examine how these candidates present themselves to their constituencies. In doing this, we find great vari- ance in the presentation styles of women running for Congress in 2018. We also find that prior political experience, more so than gender, is the primary driver in influencing how candidates (both men and women) present themselves. Experienced candidates utilize similar styles that highlight their past political work while amateur candidates are more likely to use “values-driven” language.
