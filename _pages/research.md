My current work examines (1) the ways in which political elites message and pass public policy to maximize electoral chances and (2) the effect of elite rhetoric, public policy, and real world events on voters' behavior and political attitudes. I have primarily focused on these questions in the context of Congress, specifically intra-party competition within the Democratic Party, but I also have research applying these questions during the 2020 presidential election. Additionally, I have worked as a part of a research team assessing the factors that contribute to racial disparities in traffic stops.

"Infectious Moderation: Personal Experiences and Political Attitudes during Covid-19". [[Working Paper]](/files/infectiousmoderation.pdf)

>Party elites in the United States sent drastically different messages about government priorities and who was to blame for the Covid-19 pandemic. Given the current era of hyper-partisanship, one would expect public opinion to diverge and follow partisan messaging faithfully. However, the Covid-19 pandemic provided citizens with personal experiences that were potentially powerful enough overcome partisan motivated reasoning and encourage voters to hold politicians accountable. Using a mix of cross sectional and panel data, I find that being personally infected with Covid-19 moderated the effects of partisanship in shaping political attitudes where citizens might otherwise be expected to follow partisan cues. Those same personal experiences carried electoral consequences for the 2020 presidential election. Although the events associated with the 2020 pandemic and presidential election are unlikely to repeat themselves, these results carry broader implications for citizens' capacity to hold attitudes independent of partisanship. Partisanship is certainly a powerful force, even in the face of a global pandemic, but its influence does have boundaries.

"The Democratic Divide: Factional Differences in Issue Frames within the Democratic Party". [[Working Paper]](/files/democraticdivide.pdf)

> In 2018, the rise of the progressive faction represented a significant change to the operation of the Democratic coalition. However, we know little about how the new wave of progressive candidates altered issue conflict. Using text analysis of issue statements from over 600 Democratic primary candidates for the House of Representatives in 2018, I show significant differences between how progressive and moderate candidates frame issues. These framing differences manifest in discussion about the economy, the environment, and healthcare, but I find no differences for education and immigration. Progressive candidates are more likely to use issue frames that focus on the systematic elements of policy proposals (e.g.  economic fairness, the role of large corporations, emissions, insurance companies, and pharmaceutical industry).  Moderate candidates tend to focus more on the personal, practical impact of these proposals (e.g. middle- and working-class economic hardships, community preservation, and cost of healthcare). Such differences suggest both evidence of the divergent elite behavior and potential underlying divides in how voters think about political issues within the Democratic Party.

"Purchasing Privilege? Driver Identity, Status Cues, and Police Suspicion" *with Frank Baumgartner and Will Spillman* Under Review [[Working Paper]](/files/PurchasingPrivilege.pdf)

> In a traffic stop, officers routinely make decisions about the possibility of criminal activity of drivers based on very little information; the decision to conduct a search is an indicator of this suspicion. We review more than 10 million traffic stops conducted by the Texas Highway Patrol to assess which drivers are subjected to search, confirming previous findings with regard to identity-related variables. We are able to assess two new variables here, however: Occupational status, and social status. Professional drivers of long-haul trucks and inter-city buses are rarely subjected to search. Among drivers of passenger cars and SUVs, we assess social status by comparing luxury brands with others. In both cases, we find that status-cues strongly affect the odds of search. Many citizens are routinely subjected to increased police scrutiny, and many see reduced scrutiny. These routine police decisions are clearly based on systematic and inaccurate stereotypes.

"Partisan Appeals to Bipartisanship" *with Emily Cottle*

> How do members of Congress build public support for legislation? Many argue it is through the framing of the legislative process or carefully curated explanations that appeal to their constituents' preferences. Others have claimed, in particular, that when members appeal to bipartisanship — signaling to the public that the legislation at hand was crafted through compromise and is liked by members on both sides of the aisle — members are successful in building support for a given bill. Given the hyper-partisan era that presently exists, however, these bipartisan appeals are unlikely to occur in a vacuum. Members in the minority consistently engage in partisan counter framing in attempts to undermine legislation. In this paper we demonstrate that the benefits awarded to members by engaging in bipartisan appeals are marginal at best. Members of Congress who engage in partisan counter framing can successfully reinforce the support of their own base while undermining their opponent’s legislative accomplishments. While bipartisan legislating is something citizens generally desire from Congress, partisan counter messaging eliminates those benefits and reinforces polarization.
