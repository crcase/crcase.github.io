My current work examines (1) the ways in which political elites message and pass public policy to maximize electoral chances and (2) the effect of elite rhetoric, public policy, and real world events on voters' behavior and political attitudes. I have primarily focused on these questions in the context of Congress, specifically intra-party competition in primary elections, but I also have research applying these questions more broadly. Additionally, I have worked as a part of a research team assessing the factors that contribute to racial disparities in traffic stops.

> How do members of Congress build public support for legislation? Many argue it is through the framing of the legislative process or carefully curated explanations that appeal to their constituents' preferences. Some suggest the key to members of Congress building public support for legislation is appealing to bipartisanship â€” signaling to the public that legislation was crafted through compromise and is liked by members on both sides of the aisle. Given the hyper-partisan era that presently exists, however, these bipartisan appeals are unlikely to occur in a vacuum. The minority party has incentives to engage in counter framing to undermine support for legislation. We demonstrate that the benefits awarded to members by engaging in bipartisan appeals are overstated. By engaging in counter messaging, members in the minority party can undermine the legislative accomplishments of their opponents, as well as approval for the legislature. Minority-party members, however, must be careful in how they counter message: partisan, rather than neutral, messages actually increase support for the legislature's majority party while decreasing support for the minority party.

### Working Papers

"Infectious Moderation: Personal Experiences and Political Attitudes during Covid-19." [[Working Paper]](/files/infectiousmoderation.pdf)

>Party elites in the United States sent drastically different messages about government priorities and who was to blame for the Covid-19 pandemic. Given the current era of hyper-partisanship, one would expect public opinion to diverge and follow partisan messaging faithfully. However, the Covid-19 pandemic provided citizens with personal experiences that were potentially powerful enough overcome partisan motivated reasoning and encourage voters to hold politicians accountable. Using a mix of cross sectional and panel data, I find that being personally infected with Covid-19 moderated the effects of partisanship in shaping political attitudes where citizens might otherwise be expected to follow partisan cues. Those same personal experiences carried electoral consequences for the 2020 presidential election. Although the events associated with the 2020 pandemic and presidential election are unlikely to repeat themselves, these results carry broader implications for citizens' capacity to hold attitudes independent of partisanship. Partisanship is certainly a powerful force, even in the face of a global pandemic, but its influence does have boundaries.


"Purchasing Privilege? Driver Identity, Status Cues, and Police Suspicion." *with Frank Baumgartner and Will Spillman.* [[Working Paper]](/files/PurchasingPrivilege.pdf)

> In a traffic stop, officers routinely make decisions about the possibility of criminal activity of drivers based on very little information; the decision to conduct a search is an indicator of this suspicion. We review more than 10 million traffic stops conducted by the Texas Highway Patrol to assess which drivers are subjected to search, confirming previous findings with regard to identity-related variables. We are able to assess two new variables here, however: Occupational status, and social status. Professional drivers of long-haul trucks and inter-city buses are rarely subjected to search. Among drivers of passenger cars and SUVs, we assess social status by comparing luxury brands with others. In both cases, we find that status-cues strongly affect the odds of search. Many citizens are routinely subjected to increased police scrutiny, and many see reduced scrutiny. These routine police decisions are clearly based on systematic and inaccurate stereotypes.
