My central aim in undergraduate education is to develop students' ability to engage with and understand the political world around them. Further, I strive to help students develop skills that will benefit them in future courses, their professional career, and as lifelong participants in their political system.  As such, my teaching philosophy emphasizes active learning and student engagement in class, assessments and lectures that connect class concepts to real world examples, and assignments that create opportunities for student growth and development. Below, you can find sample syllabi, assignments, and evaluations from courses I have taught as both the instructor of record and as a teaching assistant.
