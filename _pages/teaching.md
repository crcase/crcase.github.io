### The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
- Poli 281: Quantitative Research in Political Science (Summer Session 2022)
    -  The course is target towards undergraduate students with interest in the social sciences, who want to use quantitative approaches to solve important problems as well as develop marketable analytical skills. This course is designed to achieve three objectives: (1) introduce students to research and quantitative analysis in political science, (2) produce critical consumers of quantitative analysis used in political and policy-oriented reporting, and (3) give students the ability to answer questions of social scientific importance using data. Over the course of the semester, students learn and become proficient in the statistical programming language R. 
 
        
- Poli 100: Introduction to American Politics (Fall 2020 (TA), Fall 2021 (TA))
    - In order to fully understand our complicated and contentious political climate and events, it is necessary to understand how the American political system works. We will work toward that understanding together by exploring the system from two angles: *institutions*, or the structure of the United States government; and *behavior*, or the actions and motivations of political actors, both politicians and the general public. We will discuss what problems the government and political system seek to solve and why they sometimes succeed and sometimes fail to solve those problems.

- Poli 203: Race, Innocence, and End of the Death Penalty (Spring 2022 (TA))
    - This class is about a surprising political development that is happening right around us: The death penalty seems to be disappearing. A large majority of Americans has traditionally supported the death penalty in the abstract. But across the country since the mid-1990s, the numbers of death sentences and executions have been declining. Admissions to death row have also slowed to a trickle, compared to previous decades. North Carolina has sentenced no more than 3 individuals to death in any single year since 2010, and has not carried out an execution since 2006. The 2009 Racial Justice Act allowed condemned individuals to present statistical evidence that racial bias may have affected their sentencing. In a 2015 US Supreme Court decision, Justice Stephen Breyer called for a “full briefing” on the constitutionality of the death penalty nationwide. President Trump jump-started federal executions and added several prodeath penalty justices, so Justice Breyer’s call for a briefing might not lead to the result he would prefer. On the other hand, President Biden has vowed to end the federal death penalty, and states have continued to move away from the punishment, imposing very few sentences and carrying
out even fewer executions. Several states have recently abolished the death penalty, including long-time users Virginia and Illinois. These are the trends we’ll explore this semester.
